# Visualization

The python script `_citydb_demo.py`provides a short/protoypical connection between the provided library `citygml2-to-osi3` and the OSI3 viewer from [PMSF IT consulting](https://pmsf.eu/). In case you want to utilize this script the [PMSF FMI Bench](https://pmsf.eu/products/fmibench/) with its visualizer is required. This tool provides a nice and simple interface with 3d visualization capabilities.

## Alternative

An alternative therefore would be the usage of the freely available [OSI-Visualizer](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-visualizer) with 2d capabilites (until now).
